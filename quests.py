#Quest 1: Your First Spell
#Concept: print() - The command to make the computer talk.
#How to use it: print("Your message here")
#Why it's important: This is your window into the program's mind. It lets you see what's happening, display results, and check for mistakes.
#Logical Reasoning: If I want to see something on the screen, I need to explicitly tell the computer to print it.
#The Quest: Write a Python script that prints out a cool welcome message for a fellow adventurer.
print("Hello Adventurer, welcome to the great unknown!")

#Quest 2: The Naming Ceremony
#Concept: Variables - These are like labeled boxes where you can store information.
#How to use it: variable_name = "some value"
#Why it's important: Variables give names to data so you can remember and reuse it easily.
#Logical Reasoning: If I need to remember a piece of information for later, I should store it in a variable with a memorable name.
#The Quest: Create variables for a hero's name and their superpower. Print a sentence that introduces the hero and their power.
hero_name = "Jake"
hero_super_power = "speed of light"
print(f"The hero is {hero_name} and his super power is {hero_super_power}")


#Quest 3: The Treasure Chest
#Concept: Data Types - Python treats text (string) and numbers (integer, float) differently.
#How to use it: name = "Gandalf", level = 20
#Why it's important: Knowing the type of data is crucial. You can do math with numbers, but not with text.
#Logical Reasoning: I must use quotes for text to tell Python it's a string.
#The Quest: Create variables for your age (an integer) and favorite food (a string). Print them in a single sentence
age = 25
favorite_food = "ugali"
print(f"I am {age} years old and my favourite food is {favorite_food}.")

#Quest 4: The Town Crier
#Concept: Combining variables and strings for output.
#How to use it: print("Hello, " + hero_name) or f-strings: print(f"Hello, {hero_name}")
#Why it's important: You'll almost always be displaying information stored in your variables.
#Logical Reasoning: To create a dynamic message, I need to combine my fixed text with the values stored in my variables.
#The Quest: Create variables for a city name, the current year, and your name. Print a message like: "Welcome to [City Name]! The year is [Year], and our newest resident is [Your Name]."
city_name = "Kigali"
year = "2023"
newest_resident = "Mach"
print(f"Welcome to {city_name}! The year is {year}, and our newest resident is {newest_resident}.")

#Quest 5: The Echoing Cave
#Concept: Reassigning Variables - The value in a variable's "box" can be changed.
#How to use it: player_score = 100; player_score = 150
#Why it's important: Data changes! A player's score goes up, a character's location changes, time passes. Variables need to be updatable.
#Logical Reasoning: The = sign is an assignment, not a permanent declaration of equality.
#The Quest: Create a player_health variable and set it to 100. A monster attacks! Subtract 25. The player finds a potion! Add 10. Print the final health.
player_health = 100
player_health -=25
player_health += 10
print(f"The final health is {player_health}")

#LEVEL 2    
#Quest 6: The Fortune Teller
#Concept: input() - How to ask the user a question and get their answer.
#How to use it: user_answer = input("What is your name? ")
#Why it's important: This makes your programs interactive!
#Logical Reasoning: If I want the user to give me information, I need to use input() to pause the program and wait for their typed response.
#The Quest: Ask the user for their name and quest, then print a confirmation message.
name = input("What is your name? ")
user_quest = input("what is your quest? ")
print(f"Your name is {name}, and your quest is {user_quest}. Thank you for the input")

#Quest 7: The Magic Number Converter
#Concept: Type Conversion - Changing data from one type to another.
#How to use it: number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
#Why it's important: The input() function always gives you a string. If you want to do math, you must convert it to a number.
#Logical Reasoning: A computer sees "5" from an input as a word. I must tell it to reinterpret that word as a number before I can do math with it.
#The Quest: Ask the user for their birth year, convert it to an integer, and calculate their approximate age.
birth_year = int(input("Please enter your birth year: "))
age = 2026 - birth_year
print(f"You are {age} years old")

#Quest 8: The Potion Brewer
#Concept: Basic Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /).
#How to use it: result = 10 * 5
#Why it's important: This is the foundation of all calculation in programming.
#Logical Reasoning: I can use math symbols directly in my code to perform calculations on numbers.
#The Quest: You need 3 dragon scales (10 gold each) and 5 elf tears (3 gold each). Calculate the total cost.
dragon_scales = 3 * 10
elf_tears = 5 * 3
total_cost = dragon_scales + elf_tears
print(f"The total cost of making my potion is {total_cost}")

#Quest 9: The Greedy Goblin
#Concept: The Modulo Operator (%) - This gives you the remainder of a division.
#How to use it: leftover = 10 % 3 (Result is 1).
#Why it's important: It's great for checking if a number is even or odd, and for distributing items evenly.
#Logical Reasoning: When I divide A by B, what is left over? The modulo operator tells me just that.
#The Quest: A goblin has 27 gold pieces to share among 4 friends. Calculate how many pieces each friend gets and how many the goblin keeps (the remainder).
goblin_gold = 27
friends_share = goblin_gold // 4
remainder = 27 % 4

print(f"Each friend gets: {friends_share} gold pieces")
print(f"The goblin is left with : {remainder} gold pieces")


#Quest 10: The Architect's Blueprint
#Concept: Floating-Point Numbers (float) - Numbers with decimal points.
#How to use it: price = 9.99
#Why it's important: Not all math involves whole numbers. Measurements and money often require decimals.
#Logical Reasoning: If my calculation might result in a fraction, I should use float to ensure the decimal part isn't lost.
#The Quest: Calculate the area of a rectangle. Ask the user for the length and width (they can be decimals) and print the area.
length = float(input("Please type the length "))
width = float(input("Please type the width "))

area = length * width 
print(f"The area is: {area}")

#LEVEL 3
#Quest 11: The Guardian of the Bridge
#Concept: if statement - This lets your program make a decision.
#How to use it: if age > 18: print("You may pass.")
#Why it's important: This is how programs become "smart." They can react differently to different situations.
#Logical Reasoning: If a specific condition is met, then execute the following code.
#The Quest: Ask for the user's age. If it's 18 or greater, print a message that they are old enough to vote.
age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are old enough to vote")
#else: 
    #print("You have a few years to go")

#Quest 12: The Two-Path Cave
#Concept: if-else statement - This provides an alternative path.
#How to use it: if choice == "left": print("Treasure!") else: print("Pit!")
#Why it's important: It handles all possibilities, providing a default action if the condition isn't met.
#Logical Reasoning: If this is true, do action A. For all other cases, do action B.
#The Quest: Create a password checker. If the user enters the correct password, print "Access Granted," otherwise print "Access Denied."
password = input("Please input a password: ")
if password == "catsanddogs":
    print("Access Granted")
else:
    print("Access Denied")

#Quest 13: The Maze of Many Choices
#Concept: if-elif-else statement - This lets you check multiple different conditions in a row.
#Why it's important: It allows for complex decision-making with more than two options.
#Logical Reasoning: If A is true, do this. Else, if B is true, do that. If none are true, do the final `else` action.
#The Quest: Write a grading program. Ask for a score (0-100). Print "A" for 90+, "B" for 80-89, "C" for 70-79, and "Needs Improvement" otherwise.
score = int(input("Enter score (0-100): "))
if score >= 90:
    print("A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("C")
else:
    print("Needs Improvement")

#Quest 14: The Logical Gatekeeper
#Concept: Logical Operators (and, or, not) - These let you combine multiple conditions.
#Why it's important: Real-world decisions often depend on more than one factor.
#Logical Reasoning: To enter the castle, you must have a key AND know the password.
#The Quest: A club bouncer requires guests to be 18+ AND have 20+ gold coins. Ask the user for their age and gold, and tell them if they can enter.


#Quest 15: The Nested Riddle
#Concept: Nested if Statements - An if statement inside another.
#Why it's important: It allows for a second layer of decision-making after a first condition is met.
#Logical Reasoning: First, check if the user has a key. If they do, THEN check if it's the right color.
#The Quest: Mini-adventure. Ask if they go "left" or "right". If "left", ask if they "swim" or "wait". If they swim, they find a treasure. All other choices lead to a different outcome.


#LEVEL 4
#Quest 16: The Marching Ants
#Concept: for loop - Repeats code a specific number of times.
#How to use it: for i in range(5): print("Hello")
#Why it's important: It automates repetitive tasks.
#Logical Reasoning: For every item in this sequence, perform this action.
#The Quest: Use a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.


#Quest 17: The Endless Staircase
#Concept: while loop - Repeats code as long as a condition is true.
#Why it's important: Perfect for when you don't know how many repetitions you need.
#Logical Reasoning: While this condition is true, keep executing this block of code.
#The Quest: Start a counter at 0. Use a while loop that stops when the count reaches 5.


#Quest 18: The Loop of Riddles
#Concept: Using a while loop with a user-input condition.
#Why it's important: It's the basis for games, user menus, and data processing.
#Logical Reasoning: I will keep repeating this action until the user provides the correct input to stop the loop.
#The Quest: Write a guessing game. Think of a secret number. Use a while loop to keep asking the user to guess until they get it right.


#Quest 19: The Countdown
#Concept: The range() function with three arguments: range(start, stop, step).
#Why it's important: It gives you more control over your for loops.
#Logical Reasoning: range() lets me define my own start, end, and step size.
#The Quest: Simulate a rocket launch. Use a for loop with range() to count down from 10 to 1, then print "Blastoff!".


#Quest 20: The Even Number Forager
#Concept: Using if inside a for loop.
#Why it's important: This lets you process items in a sequence and make a decision about each one.
#Logical Reasoning: For each number in this range, check if it meets my condition. If it does, perform an action.
#The Quest: Loop through numbers 1 to 20. Use an if statement to check if the number is even. If it is, print it.


#Level 5: The Alchemist's Lab (Functions)
#Quest 21: The Reusable Incantation
#Concept: Defining a function with def.
#Why it's important: Functions let you package up code you want to reuse. This is the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.
#Logical Reasoning: Instead of copying and pasting code, I'll put it in a function and "call" it by name.
#The Quest: Create a function greet_adventurer() that prints a welcome message. Call it three times.


#Quest 22: The Personalized Scroll
#Concept: Functions with parameters (arguments).
#Why it's important: This makes functions flexible. They can act on the specific data you give them.
#Logical Reasoning: My function needs information to do its job. I'll define "parameters" as placeholders for that information.
#The Quest: Create a function personalized_greeting(name, quest). Ask the user for their name and quest, then call your function with their answers.


#Quest 23: The Oracle's Vision
#Concept: Functions that return a value.
#Why it's important: Many functions are designed to perform a calculation and give back the result.
#Logical Reasoning: This function's job is to compute a value. After it's done, it should return the final answer.
#The Quest: Write a function calculate_area(length, width) that returns the area. Call it for two different rectangles and print the results.


#Quest 24: The Master Spell
#Concept: Calling a function from within another function.
#Why it's important: This is how you build complex programs from simple, reusable parts.
#Logical Reasoning: I can break a big problem down into smaller tasks. Each task becomes a function.
#The Quest: Create ask_for_age() which returns an age, and can_they_vote(age) which prints a message. Call the first, then pass its result to the second.


#Level 6: The Grand Challenge
#Quest 25: The Number Wizard
#The Quest: Upgrade your number guessing game. After each wrong guess, tell the user if their guess was "too high" or "too low".

#Quest 26: The Simple Calculator
#The Quest: Write a program that acts as a simple calculator. Ask for two numbers and an operation (`add`, `subtract`, etc.). Use functions for each operation and an `if-elif-else` chain to call the correct one.

#Quest 27: The FizzBuzz Test
#The Quest: A classic challenge. Print numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz". For multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For multiples of both, print "FizzBuzz".

#Quest 28: The Adventure Begins
#The Quest: Create a text-based "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. Use functions for different locations and have at least two different endings.

#Quest 29: The Code Breaker
#The Task: Translate the following human logic into a Python script: Allow a user 3 attempts to guess the secret code (`42`). Give feedback on each guess and stop the game on a correct guess or after 3 failed attempts.


#Quest 30: The Reflective Scribe
#The Quest: Go back to three of your previous assignments and add comments (# like this) to explain what each part of your code does and why.
